  abstract = {Data command files allow users to define set and parameter data that can be used to construct a model instance from an abstract Pyomo model. This chapter discusses the format of these data commands, as well as the various data declarations that Pyomo supports. Pyomo’s data commands include both direct specifications of data, as well as specifications that indicate how data is to be extracted from a variety of different sources: ASCII table files, CSV files, spreadsheets, and databases.},
